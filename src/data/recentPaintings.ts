    notes: `My first painting in almost 4 years! I was too lazy and unmotivated to make anything 
        during uni. This scene is apparently from Nausicaa Valley of the Wind - I loved the movie, 
        but I don't remember it. I decided to recreate this painting instead of making something original to ease 
        my transition into doing art again after my 4 year gap.`,
