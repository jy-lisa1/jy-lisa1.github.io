      it too. Most of the time was spent on the background, which took longer than expected, but the 
      cat itself was pretty quick. My favourite parts are the ears (they look like strawberries) 
      and the whiskers! =^-w-^=`,

    notes: `Had a lot of fun with this one! I really wanted to try out a trick I saw on TikTok, where they used
      a pallet knife to create the texture on the rocks. I was panicking at first because it wasn't working, but
      after a lot of trial and error, I think it worked out pretty well in the end. This one only took 
      6 hours to complete! Usually a painting of this size takes me at least a whole weekend.`,

    notes: `Wanted to try something different since I've been exclusively painting water and landscapes lately. 
      Deer have always been one of my favourite animals, they're so pretty! I used a large flat brush to create 
      a blurred out background, and smaller flat brushes for the fur. I like the way the painting turned out, 
      but it gave me HORRENDOUS back & neck pain for days because I painted it while awkwardly 
      kneeling, hunched over on the floor. One day I will have a more comfortable setup!`,

    notes: `Reminds me of a lighthouse I saw around Vancouver Island, where I took a really similar 
      picture when I was on a BC Ferry. I bought a set of mop brushes for this piece so I can blend the sky better, 
      and I love how smooth it looks in comparison to my previous paintings. I also used the pallet knife trick 
      on the rocks.`,

    notes: `My first painting of 2025 - I love the way the sunlight glows in the orange part of the clouds. 
      I haven't painted water in years, and I forgot how satisfying it feels watching it all come together!
      This was also my first time using linseed oil to dilute the paints, and it made my life SO MUCH EASIER. The
      paint glides smoothly over the canvas like soft butter on toast, and I no longer need to fight for my life 
      trying to get it to behave the way I want it to.`,
