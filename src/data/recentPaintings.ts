    notes: `Reminds me of a lighthouse I saw around Vancouver Island, where I took a really similar 
      picture when I was on a BC Ferry. I bought a set of mop brushes for this piece so I can blend the sky better, 
      and I love how smooth it looks in comparison to my previous paintings. I also used the pallet knife trick 
      on the rocks.`,

    notes: `Had a lot of fun with this one! I really wanted to try out a trick I saw on TikTok, where they used
      a pallet knife to create the texture on the rocks. I was panicking at first because it wasn't working, but
      after a lot of trial and error, I think it worked out pretty well in the end. This one only took 
      6 hours to complete! Usually a painting of this size takes me at least a whole weekend.`,

    notes: `My first painting of 2025 - I love the way the sunlight glows in the orange part of the clouds. 
      I haven't painted water in years, and I forgot how satisfying it feels watching it all come together!
      This was also my first time using linseed oil to dilute the paints, and it made my life SO MUCH EASIER. The
      paint glides smoothly over the canvas like soft butter on toast, and I no longer need to fight for my life 
      trying to get it to behave the way I want it to.`,

    notes: `My first painting in almost 4 years! I was too lazy and unmotivated to make anything 
        during uni. I decided to recreate this painting instead of making something original to ease my 
        transition into doing art again after my 4 year gap. Replicating paintings also helps me learn new 
        techniques and styles, which is primarily how I learned to paint when I was a kid. This scene is 
        apparently from Nausicaa Valley of the Wind - I loved the movie, but I don't remember this specific shot.`,
