    notes: `After many blisters and hours of work, I completed my first woodblock carving! It's a little 
    kitty on a sword flying through the night sky, holding a little teapot. This was the first of four 
    carvings in the set I bought from the Suzhou museum gift shop. It was both easier and harder 
    than I expected, and I'm very glad I bought the kit! Found a new hobby that I'll enjoy for years 
    to come :)`,

    date: "Summer 2025",
    size: "4 x 6",
    notes: `I have so many childhood memories of going to see lotus flowers and playing with the fishies! 
    Sadly I never fully appreciated the beautiful views, since they only bloom at the peak of 
    Beijing's blistering summer heat. I still love the nostalgia that lotus flowers bring me though!`,

    falling around them. A playful and carefree scene.`,

  title: "Carving Tools",
  notes: `These are the tools that came with the carving kit, and all you need to create the prints. 
   It came with two carving knives (a round one for hollowing out bigger areas and a sharp one for details), 
   a roller to evenly distribute paint onto the blocks, and a wooden mushroom to transfer the paint from 
   the blocks to the paper. The paint they gave me was oil-based, but I did NOT enjoy cleaning up 
   the mess so I bought some water-based paint instead.`,
